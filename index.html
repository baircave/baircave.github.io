            <p>
                At Odd Harmonics, sound is a sandbox, which means we cultivate musicianship by first prioritizing hands-on creative experimentation. 
                NO EXPERTISE REQUIRED! Once we've developed an understanding of the building blocks of sound, 
                that's when we dive into more traditional musical concepts.                
                <br>
                <br>
                Our goal is to provide an alternative, complementary music education to conservatory-style institutions.
                By focusing on creating sonic worlds, we aim to unlock an underrated and highly accessible axis of expression. 
                <br>
                <br>
                From a simple beat to a fully produced song, we guide each student step by step to simplify the process of recording their own music.

                <p class="about-column">
                    Like many others, Nick's music education began with piano, guitar, and drum lessons. 
                    But his love for music making began in earnest at Brown University where he majored in both Computer Music and Computer Science. 
                    After Brown, he began his 10+ year music career by composing for ads at The Music Playground in Lower Manhattan.
                    He's since released music with independent record labels such as Tiny Waves, Mad Zoo, New Dawn Collective, & Materia Music, and has DJed events around the country.

                    <br>
                    Nick and his wife have put down roots in Park Slope where they've very recently started a family together
                    (their 5-month-old is already the proud owner of the Fisher-Price Mix and Learn DJ Table).

                    "Nick strikes that hard-to-find balance between teaching highly technical skills 
                    and inspiring creative thinking. By the end of our first lesson, we'd transformed 
                    my vocals into a voice-synth. Nick knew exactly how to connect my passion for singing 
                    with a specific technical production skill. It's this knack for uncovering his students' 
                    "why" that makes Nick’s style of teaching delightful and surprisingly personal. I highly 
                    recommend Nick to anyone looking to advance their music production skills in order to 
                    bring a creative vision to life."

                    "Learning from Nick elevated my production skills immediately. He’s great at breaking 
                    down complex concepts and giving you simple tools. Not to mention never loses track of 
                    the joy and fun in the process. Any aspiring musician / producer would be lucky to have 
                    Nick helping them get to the next level."

                    persistently accommodates for any gaps in my knowledge. He always ensures that you are 
                    getting where you need to be YOUR way, in YOUR style. He is also super friendly and fun. 
                    My experience with Nick so far has been excellent!”
